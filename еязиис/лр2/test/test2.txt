Molecular biotechnologies have developed rapidly and substantially since the release of
these previous guidelines. The livestock sector has been an active participant in the so-called
“genomic revolution.” Advancements in the sequencing of genomes and related genotyping methods have created opportunities for gathering much more information on the molecular level than ever possible, at a faster rate, and for exponentially decreased costs.

Scientists and other livestock stakeholders in countries with highly developed economies
have been among the main beneficiaries of this revolution. However, the greatly decreased
costs of genomic applications have also created opportunities in countries with developing
and transitional economies. In many instances, the lack of awareness of these opportunities
and in the technical capacity for the full application of genomic tools may represent a greater obstacle to their utilization than the expenses involved.

The development of this document and the subsequent application of the information
contained herein may help to bridge this gap, bringing new opportunities to light and
transferring knowledge that can be used to increase the genetic characterization of AnGR
and subsequently improve the sustainable use and conservation of livestock genetic diversity came
