We have already alluded to the diversities observed in the attachment of these organs to
the belly and the adjacent region; in other words, we have stated that in some cases the
testicles are tightly fastened back, as in the pig and its allies, and that in others they are
freely suspended, as in man.
Fishes, then, are devoid of testicles, as has been stated, and serpents also. They are
furnished, however, with two ducts connected with the midriff and running on to either
side of the backbone, coalescing into a single duct above the outlet of the residuum, and
by 'above' the outlet I mean the region near to the spine. These ducts in the rutting season
get filled with the genital fluid, and, if the ducts be squeezed, the sperm oozes out white in
colour. As to the differences observed in male fishes of diverse species, the reader should
consult my treatise on Anatomy, and the subject will be hereafter more fully discussed
when we describe the specific character in each case.
The males of oviparous animals, whether biped or quadruped, are in all cases furnished
with testicles close to the loin underneath the midriff. With some animals the organ is
whitish, in others somewhat of a sallow hue; in all cases it is entirely enveloped with
minute and delicate veins. From each of the two testicles extends a duct, and, as in the
case of fishes, the two ducts coalesce into one above the outlet of the residuum. This
constitutes the penis, which organ in the case of small ovipara is inconspicuous; but in the
case of the larger ovipara, as in the goose and the like, the organ becomes quite visible just
after copulation.
