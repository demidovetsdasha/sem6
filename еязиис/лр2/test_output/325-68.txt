The African elephant, hunted for its ivory, is one of the most endangered large mammals. Elephants are keystone species, meaning their presence supports entire ecosystems. Losing them would disrupt forests and savannas across Africa and Asia.

Similarly, tigers face severe threats from poaching and deforestation. Fewer than 4,000 remain in the wild, scattered across fragmented habitats. Conservation programs, like anti-poaching patrols and habitat restoration, are critical to their survival.

Marine species, such as sea turtles and vaquitas (the worldâ€™s smallest porpoise), are also in danger. Plastic pollution and illegal fishing nets kill thousands of marine animals each year. Efforts to clean oceans and enforce fishing regulations are essential.

Protecting endangered species requires global cooperation. Supporting wildlife organizations, reducing consumption of endangered animal products, and advocating for stronger environmental laws can make a difference.
