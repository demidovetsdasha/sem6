Animals have always been central to human culture, appearing in myths, religions, and art. Ancient civilizations worshipped animal gods, such as Egypt’s cat goddess Bastet or Hinduism’s sacred cow. Even today, animals symbolize traits like wisdom (owl), strength (lion), and freedom (eagle).

Pets, especially dogs and cats, have been human companions for thousands of years. They provide emotional support, security, and even health benefits, such as reducing stress. Therapy animals are now used in hospitals and schools to improve well-being.

In literature and film, animals often represent human qualities. From Aesop’s fables to Disney’s animated characters, they teach moral lessons and entertain audiences. Some animals, like wolves and snakes, are unfairly portrayed as villains, shaping negative perceptions.

Animals also inspire scientific and technological advancements. Studying bird flight led to the invention of airplanes, while research on bats contributed to sonar technology. Biomimicry—imitating nature’s designs—continues to drive innovation.
