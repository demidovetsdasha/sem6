Birds are among the most diverse and adaptable animals on Earth. They inhabit nearly every environment, from dense rainforests to arid deserts. Their ability to fly allows them to migrate across continents, escaping harsh weather and finding food.

Some birds, like parrots and crows, are highly intelligent. Parrots can mimic human speech, while crows use tools to solve problems. Birds of prey, such as eagles and hawks, have incredible eyesight, enabling them to spot prey from great distances.

Birds play important ecological roles. Hummingbirds pollinate flowers, while vultures clean up carrion, preventing the spread of disease. Even small birds, like sparrows, help control insect populations, benefiting agriculture and ecosystems.
