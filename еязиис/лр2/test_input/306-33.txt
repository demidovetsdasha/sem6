Migration is one of the most remarkable bird behaviors. Species like the Arctic tern travel thousands of miles each year between breeding and wintering grounds. Scientists still study how birds navigate with such precision, using the sun, stars, and Earthâ€™s magnetic field.

Sadly, many bird species are declining due to habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts, such as protecting wetlands and reducing pesticide use, are crucial to ensuring their survival.
