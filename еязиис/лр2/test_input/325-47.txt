Insects are the most abundant animals on Earth, with over a million known species. They play essential roles in pollination, decomposition, and food chains. Without insects, ecosystems would collapse, and human agriculture would suffer greatly.

Bees are perhaps the most important pollinators. They help produce fruits, vegetables, and nuts, contributing to global food security. However, bee populations are declining due to pesticides, habitat loss, and diseases, raising concerns about future food supplies.

Ants and termites are master builders, creating intricate colonies with complex social structures. Some ant species farm fungi, while others herd aphids like livestock. These behaviors show that insects can exhibit surprisingly advanced social organization.

Butterflies and moths undergo one of nature’s most incredible transformations—metamorphosis. From egg to caterpillar to adult, their life cycle is a marvel of adaptation. Many species migrate long distances, like the monarch butterfly, which travels thousands of miles across North America.

Despite their importance, insects are often overlooked or feared.
