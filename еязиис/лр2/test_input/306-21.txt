Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are vital ecosystems. They provide shelter for thousands of species, including fish, turtles, and crustaceans. Unfortunately, climate change and pollution threaten these delicate habitats, causing coral bleaching and loss of biodiversity.

Sharks, often misunderstood, play a crucial role as apex predators. By controlling the population of other marine animals, they help maintain the balance of ocean ecosystems. Despite their fearsome reputation, most shark species are not dangerous to humans.

Protecting marine life is essential for the health of our planet. Reducing plastic waste, supporting sustainable fishing, and establishing marine reserves are key steps in preserving these incredible creatures for future generations.
