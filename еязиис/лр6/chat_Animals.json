Here's a quick breakdown:\n\n- **As pets:** Dogs and cats fight for the top spot. In some countries, dogs win; in others, cats reign supreme. Goldfish are also up there in terms of sheer numbers.\n- **In culture and mythology:** Lions, eagles, and wolves are everywhere—as symbols, mascots, and legends.\n- **Most numerous:** The Antarctic krill is one of the most abundant animals by biomass. Chickens are the most common bird by population, thanks to farming.\n- **Most searched/featured online:** Cats tend to dominate memes and videos. There’s even scientific research around our obsession with cat content.\n\nDid you have a specific type of popularity in mind?"
